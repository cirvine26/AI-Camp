15\n","-£18.00\n","- £17.876\n","\n","To be able to force these to all follow the same pattern we can use regex to specify the pattern\n","\n","\n","- **\\d***  - Must contain all digits, so in this case only 15 would be accepted\n","\n","- **\\£\\d*\\.\\d**** - Every value would need to start with a '£' then be followed by any amount of numbers, it then must contain a period '.' and after the period it must contain digits\n","\n","- **\\£\\d*\\.\\d{2} *** - Every value  needs to start with a '£' then be followed by any amount of numbers, it then must contain a period '.' and after the period it must contain only 2 digits.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","So that was an example with numbers, but for countries we are working with text, so there are a range of other patterns we can use e.g. \n","- **A-Z** - Any capital letters \n","- **a-z** - Any lowercase letters \n","- **AZa-z** - Contains both uppercase and lowercase letters \n","- **\\\\.** - contains a period \n","-**\\s** - contains a space\n","\n","Once you have created your regex string you need to wrap a carrot ''^'' and a dollar sign '$'\n","<br>\n","\n","For example:\n","\n","\n","     ^regex-pattern-here$\n","
